I looked around and found this post discussing the merits of various ways of using MongoDB with Django/Python:
http://www.peterbe.com/plog/using-mongodb-in-your-django-app/django-mongodb-html5-slides/html5.html#slide23
Of the various frameworks discussed, mongoengine comes out on top, and this looks about right based on a quick scan of them.
So, time to dive into code. 

This little repo is a Django app that makes simple use of mongoengine (you must also have pymongo 1.1+ installed)
